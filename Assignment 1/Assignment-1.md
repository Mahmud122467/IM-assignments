# Assignment-1

Plot the following equations in the same plot and write a report (.md file) explaining which one is the best  

1. Logarithmic = θ(log n) 
2. Linear = θ(n) 
3. Quadratic = θ(n^2) 
4. Cubic = θ(n^3) 
5. Polynomial = θ(n^k) 

Input Values: n=7,  k=4 

## Figure comparing the run time of different functions

The above figure illustrates the relationship between run time and the size of its input (n). The logarithmic function requires the minimum amount of runtime, making this the best among the functions, while the polynomial takes the highest amount of time. Logarithmic function gets slightly slower as n grows. Besides, the linear function is simple and also shows a good result after logarithmic function. Whenever n doubles, so does the running time.

In addition, quadratic functions are practical for relatively small problems. Whenever n doubles, the running time increases fourfold. Cubic functions are also practical for use only on small problems. Whenever n doubles, the running time increases eightfold.
